## 📊 Data Format

### CSV Input Requirements

Your dataset must include these **required columns**:

| Column | Type | Range | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| `minute` | int | 0-120 | Match minute |
| `second` | int | 0-59 | Second within minute |
| `play_pattern` | int | StatsBomb ID | Play pattern identifier |
| `position` | int | StatsBomb ID | Player position |
| `shot_technique` | int | StatsBomb ID | Shooting technique |
| `shot_body_part` | int | StatsBomb ID | Body part used |
| `shot_type` | int | StatsBomb ID | Type of shot |
| `shot_open_goal` | bool | 0/1 | Open goal situation |
| `shot_one_on_one` | bool | 0/1 | One-on-one with keeper |
| `shot_aerial_won` | bool | 0/1 | Aerial duel won |
| `under_pressure` | bool | 0/1 | Under defensive pressure |
| `start_x` | float | 0-120 | Pitch X coordinate |
| `start_y` | float | 0-80 | Pitch Y coordinate |

## 🎯 Model Information

### **Default Model**
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with advanced preprocessing
- **Features**: 14 engineered features from shot characteristics
- **Preprocessing**: OneHotEncoder for categorical variables
- **Performance**: Optimized for football shot prediction

### **Custom Model Setup**
1. Train your model with the required feature set
2. Save as `xg_model.joblib` using joblib
3. Place in the root directory: `d:\Kuliah\Penelitian\xg_interface\xg_model.joblib`
4. Restart the application

**Note**: If no model is found, the application will display clear instructions on where to place your model file, including the exact path required.

### 📦 Model and Data Licensing
- The included `xg_model.joblib` (if present) is provided for demonstration purposes under the project’s MIT license unless otherwise stated.
- If you train a model using third‑party data (e.g., StatsBomb Open Data), ensure your usage complies with the data provider’s terms. This repository does not grant rights to redistribute third‑party datasets.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**🔴 Python Not Found**
```bash
# Solution: Install Python 3.8+ from python.org
# Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
```

**🔴 Permission Errors**
```bash
# Run Command Prompt as Administrator, then:
setup.bat
```

**🔴 Package Installation Fails**
```bash
# Use virtual environment:
setup_venv.bat
```

**🔴 Model Loading Error**
- Ensure `xg_model.joblib` is in the root directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify model compatibility

### 📞 **Getting Help**

1. Check `PATH_WARNING.md` for path-related issues
2. Review `MODEL_PLACEMENT.md` for model setup
3. Use virtual environment setup if persistent issues occur
4. Ensure internet connection for package downloads

## 📈 Performance Tips

- **Large datasets**: Process in smaller batches for better performance
- **Memory usage**: Close other applications when processing large files
- **Model loading**: Keep model file in root directory for faster loading
- **Visualization**: Limit shot map displays to <1000 points for optimal performance
